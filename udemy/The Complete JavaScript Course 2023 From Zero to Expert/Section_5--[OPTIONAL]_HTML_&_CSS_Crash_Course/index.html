      Here are some of the golden rules to remember how to properly use “myself”
      in a sentence: Always remember that “myself” can be used as an object as
      long as the speaker or the subject is present in the sentence. The subject
      in such a case must be first-person “I”. An example of this is “I cut
      myself while climbing the tree”.<a href="www.google.com">on google</a>.
